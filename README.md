This project is a decentralized voting application built using Cartesi Rollups. The backend handles vote submissions and vote count inspections using Cartesi Rollups APIs. This project demonstrates the use of the `advance_state`, `inspect_state`, and `voucher` APIs provided by Cartesi Rollups.

## Features

- **Vote Submission**: Users can submit their votes (yes/no).
